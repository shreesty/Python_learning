'''
Write a program that swaps the values of three variables x, y, and z, so that x gets the value
of y, y gets the value of z, and z gets the value of x.
'''
x=1
y=2
z=3

x,y,z=y,z,x
print("The value of x after swapping: ",x)
print("The value of y after swapping: ",y)
print("The value of z after swapping: ",z)
